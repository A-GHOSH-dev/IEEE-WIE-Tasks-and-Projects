### Goal
We, me and my fellow board members as the WIE board, will aim together to take our chapter to a different level. We will take care of all our members and make sure they all receive the best learning in all domains, technical, managerial, design and editorial. Our WIE team as a whole will deliver outstanding events and will make all the previous and present members and themselves proud. All members will receive the proper guidance from us, the board, and will be proud to tell they are a member of WIE. 

### Few Event goals: 

1. We are a university branch of an international chapter IEEE WIE. Hence I would like the members of WIE to get that international exposure. I am connected to other IEEE WIE chapters of few other Indian University, but would like to collaborate with international IEEE WIE and conduct an event with them.

2. Being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, we can plan to collaborate with Microsoft Learn for few events. We can receive sponsorship as well from them.

3. We will conduct our Hackathon Hackode successfully.
